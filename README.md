# Backlog

* [ ] Add TSV parsing function to the default

  * [ ] Have a safer function for scaling (where 0 is allowed, where it scales related to how it is auto aligned to the frame... , changing the characters allow for numbers, colour allow for HEX names or RGB etc d3 schemes https://d3js.org/d3-scale-chromatic/categorical
* [ ] Add more deliberite choise on what you are currently editing (and how to switch between contexts), currently the focus is not sufficient since users might start chaning elements in the meantime.

  * [ ] Add a pause sync button?
  * [ ] Add a connect button?
  * [ ] See a list of elements on the page (like files in VScode)
  * [ ] Be able to map data to the page and have the charts 'depend' on this global context
* [ ] Better examples:

  * [ ] Tufte Boxplot (vs normal boxplot)
  * [ ] Tufte 3 dimensions on one plot (x vs y, y vs z and x vs z)
  * [ ] Likert scale for questionaires
* [ ] Better UI for selecting

  * [ ] Make it more data to form style; same way as figma shows their elements and properties
  * [ ] Have prompt based coupling between raw data and parsed data for visualisation
    * [ ] Try out this concept within GPT
